            <p>England invented a game of running around kicking a ball in the mid-19th century<br> (although the Chinese claim to have played a version centuries earlier). <br>They called it “football,” not because the ball is played with the feet, but because the game is played on foot rather on horseback.<br> The term “soccer,” more commonly used in America now, was old English slang based on shortening “Assoc.,”<br> a reference to the game’s formal name, Association Football (as distinct from Rugby Football)</p>

            <h2>History </h2>
            <div id="history">
            <p>More than 240 million people around the world play soccer regularly according to the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). <br>The game has evolved from the sport of kicking a rudimentary animal-hide ball around into the World Cup sport it is today.</p>
            <p>Records trace the history of soccer back more than 2,000 years ago to ancient China. <br>Greece, Rome, and parts of Central America also claim to have started the sport; but it was England that transitioned soccer,<br> or what the British and many other people around the world call “football,” into the game we know today. <br>The English are credited with recording the first uniform rules for the sport, including forbidding tripping opponents and touching the ball with hands.</p>
