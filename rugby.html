                <p>Rugby is said to have originated at Rugby School in Warwickshire, England, in 1823 when during a game of football,<br> William Webb Ellis decided to pick up a ball and go with it.<br> Although there is very little evidence to support this theory, the Rugby World Cup Trophy is now named after William Webb Ellis.</p>
