    </div>
        <p>
           Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,<br> through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability<br> and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases,<br> entertainment for spectators. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants,<br> through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants,<br> either in teams or competing as individuals

        <h2>Types of Sports</h2>
        <p>Today we are going to focus on three types of sports,which are as follows; <br>*Football <br>*Rugby</p>
        
    <h2>Benefits of sports</h2>
    <p>As a result of sports it comes with benefits which includes;<br><ul><li>Economic benefits</li><br> <li>Health  benefits</li><br> <li>Social&cultural benefits</li></ul></p>
    <ol>
        <li><h2>Economic Benefits</h2></li>
        <p>
                The value of sport to local government and communities extends beyond sport for sport’s sake. There is considerable evidence of sport’s role in delivering a wide variety of benefits to communities and individuals, including economic growth.

                Sport can help increase economic prosperity, provide employment opportunities and contribute towards raising aspirations and increasing skill levels.
                
                Sports activities and events, sports facilities, sports volunteering, sports leadership, sports training and sport employment schemes all help develop the knowledge, skills and productivity of individuals and communities and create strong and vibrant neighbourhoods and cities where people want to live and businesses invest.
            </p>
        <li><h2>Health Benefits</h2></li>            
        <p>
                There’s strong evidence that taking part in sport improves health, with associated economic benefits. 
                Whatever our age, there is good scientific evidence that being physically active can help us lead healthier lives.<br> Regular physical activity can reduce the risk of many chronic conditions, including coronary heart disease,<br> stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, mental health problems and musculoskeletal conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING</h2>
        <p>Participation in physical activity and sport has been shown to be effective for reducing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>depression</li>
          <li>anxiety</li>
          <li>psychological distress</li>
          <li>emotional disturbance</li>
        </ul>
         <p>A review of research on this topic found that low-to-moderate physical exercise, even in a single session, can reduce anxiety.

            Another year-long study concluded that increases in aerobic fitness have both short and long-term beneficial effects on psychological health.
                    
            Research also shows taking part in sport, and spectating, have a positive impact on the wellbeing and happiness of individuals.</p></p>
        <li><h2>Social & Cultural Benefits</h2></li>
        <p>The Culture and Sport Evidence (CASE) programme Open in a new window, led by the Department for Culture Media and Sport, has studied published evidence on the varied benefits of sport.</p>
        <h3>Key findings include:
            </h3>
        <p>Young people’s participation in sport improves their numeracy scores by 8% on average above non-participants.
            Underachieving young people who take part in sport see a 29% increase in numeracy skills and a 12 to 16% rise in other transferable skills.
            Returns on investment in sports programmes for at-risk youth are estimated at £7.35 of social benefit for every £1 spent – through financial savings to police, the criminal justice system and the community.</p>
            <h3>CRIME REDUCTION AND COMMUNITY SAFETY</h3>
            <p>Sport programmes aimed at youths at risk of criminal behaviour can enhance self-esteem and reduce reoffending, studies have found.

              Some research indicates sport is most effective in this field as part of wider development programmes.</p>
